# Backup Retention Strategy
# Select one of the following strategies:
# 1: Keep one backup for each of the last 7 days, each of the last 4 weeks, each of the last 12 months

# 3: If at least one newer backup is found, all backups older than this date are deleted
# 4: Nothing will be deleted. The backup size will grow with each change
